                      <p class="text-muted">When I was only 19-years-old and learned I was pregnant with my daughter, you would imagine that I would have felt a Heavenly bliss, right? Unfortunately, what I felt instead was scared and absolutely powerless over my situation. Earlier on within that year, my oldest brother and I had both been charged with 2 Counts of Arson, Burglary, Criminal Tresspassing, Assault, and Terrorizing. All I could think was, "How can I bring a child into this world and not be there for it?" My heart was shattering inside my chest and I immediately began to cry. Given the fact that I don't believe in abortion, and have an amazing support system on both her father's side and my own, we went through with the pregnancy knowing there was a chance I could be facing jail time. I say, "a chance" because I hoped that after my brother had learned that I was pregnant, he would man up and take responsibilty for what happened on that fateful night. Needless to say, he didn't. Instead he turned states witness against me and made a deal with the District Attorney. He hoped that when it came time for me to be sentenced, that where the state originally offered him 2 and a half years to admit what happened, (considering his criminal record of years in and out of jail and prison) and that I'd never been in trouble, was a pregnant female, with no incriminating evidence against me other than his testimony against me stating I was the only one alone in the house at any period of time, he assumed I would get a small amount of jail time and probation. That way, I could get out to birth my child. This wasn't the case. I was sentenced to 9 years, all but 4 years suspended, with 5 years hanging. In other words, I was sentenced to 4 years in prison, and 4 years probation. If I messed up on that? Back to prison again for another 5 more years! Ultimately,I ended up giving birth to my beautiful and precious baby girl in prison 6 months later. Only being able to spend 2 days with her until having her ripped away from me and thrown back into a dark, lonely, cold cell. An environment where nobody could ever understand the extremities of what I was going through.</p>

After 4 years of Hell, I'd finally been set free. I had my beautiful little girl, I was enrolled in the University of Maine, Augusta College, I was surrounded by all my loved ones and friends, and I had my freedom at last. Yet, not even 3 months later I lost my father to an accidental suicide. A sick man's unfortunate attempt to express to his beloved wife that he couldn't ever live life if she were to leave him. Then, when she found him, she would realize the depth of her love and be so heartbroken over the loss-except, he wasn't supposed to have died. Granted, this isn't the thinking of the most rational person. We're aren't here to dicuss that. This is just what happened. This, is how my father ended up dying; How I ended up dying right along with him. This, is what caused my addiction.</p></div>

I began developing nightmares that surrounded his death, or ones in which the same incident occured to another brother of mine. As if it was a premonition. I would wake up sweating and crying scared to death. As most stories go, I had been seeing a guy that was into drugs. So, in that type of lifestyle, with all good intentions, he attempted to help ease my pain and suffering by giving me lines of Percocets 15's and 30's. He couldn't bare watching me cry and drink myself into oblivion anymore. Everytime I did I would end up talking about suicide and "want be with my father". I just wasn't enjoyable to be around. The drugs took hold fast. I loved the feeling they gave me. More so, the fact that they numbed the horrible feelings that I was experiancing because I didn't know the proper coping mechinisms to deal with what I was going through properly. Things continued to spiral out of control fast. Before I knew it my life flashed before my eyes once again.

Now, I have spent the last 9 years of my life locked up in the Maine Correctional Center once again on an Aggravated Assault charge. I hurt an intoxicated man on my own property that was scaring my little girl, giving my mother horrible anxiety, and smashing my furniture on the evening of my deceased father's first birthday after his passing. But in small towns, I feel as if it's more about who you are and what your history consists of, not so much about justice. Since being here, it's been a roler-coaster ride. I was actually sentenced to a straight 8 year sentence. Yet, I will be walking out after doing 9, and leaving with a year probation due to my behavior while incarcerated.
                            During my last year, (approximently) is when the Medicated Assisted Treatment Program has started here. From experiance, as an addict, and experiance, I can say that in my opinion it has been the worst "Release Recovery Program" I have ever seen them begin in all my years doing time. THe only thing it's done is stolen opportunities for those of us with a drug addiction to regain 100% sobriety. It's shielded us from being able to have that clear vision and clear mind that we need in order to make the right goals set for us to succeed in life. Without any type of substitute clouding our judgement. Everything inside of here has changed since the M.A.T. Program has arrived. On both sides of the fence. Everything is based around how to make Suboxone work for people now. Not on how to make people succeed in life in general. Hasn't anyone ever stopped to think that maybe people CAN make it without drugs? That maybe with encouragment and positive reinforcement alone that people can conquer their dreams? BELIEF! HOPE! FAITH! Hello, my name's Amber, and I'm an addict. I am strong-willed and I do NOT want to do ANY drugs anymore. Yet, in this environment, (prison) which is supposed to be safe, I felt trapped, ended up relapsing and ended up on the M.A.T. Program after 8 years. On my own I decided I wanted to detox off of it before my release. I went from 12 milligrams all the way down until I was on day one of my detox; and as a full time student during finals week! Due to not getting the proper support and understanding that I needed in here, it made my detox impossible. Ultimately, I ended up fainting from being dehydrated. An officer had refused to let me in my room because she didn't feel like getting up at the time. After this incident, I was lugged from the Pre-Release Center where I had a laptop to take my online college courses, back to the prison for an over-night medical observation. A place where I wouldn't be ablt to turn in my final exams. Which resulted in leaving me with failing grades for my entire semester. Not only that, I now feel uncomfertable about coming off Suboxone in here. Therefore, I am back on Subxone only tome off it again once I leave. Which only decreases my chance of success in doing so.</p>
