                    <p class="definition">Addiction is a chronic disease of which compulsion and uncontrollable, drug seeking, despite harmful consequenses,are a serious part of. This causes changes in the brain, which can last for an unknown length of time, depending on the amount and possibly length of use. These changes in the brain can lead to the harmful behaviors seen in people who use drugs. Relapse is also a part of the disease. Relapse causes us to go back to use after trying to stop.

                        <p class="struggles">Throughout life we go through different struggles. Whether these begin in adolescence at home resulting from traumatic events, or later on down the road in the form of mental health issues such as Depression, Bipolar Effective Disorder, Borderline Disorder, Schizophrenia, Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, or ADHD/ADD or lack of treatment of these, medical diagnosis that cause stressors, unemployement, homelessness, or there are the 40-60% of us that have addiction handed down in our family genetics, which means we are predisposed to having some kind of addiction in our lifetimes at some point already, without any help from any of these challenges helping it along behind the scenes. One thing that is for sure, this thing we find ourselves defined by does not go away, we have to take control of IT so it can no longer control US by taking the correct steps and that is made possible by having the ability to access resources. </p>

                                People who experience adversity and traume during childhood are more likely to use alcohol and other drugs during adolescence and to iniciate substance use earlier.
                            </li> 
                            <li>
                                Many individuals who develop substance use disorders (SUD) are also diagnosed with mental disorders, and vice versa. Multiple national population surveys have found that about half of those who experience a mental illness during their lives will also experience a substance use disorder and vice versa. Although there are fewer studies on comorbidity among youth, research suggests that adolescents with substance use disorders also have high rates of co-occurring mental illness; over 60 percent of adolescents in community-based substance use disorder treatment programs also meet diagnostic criteria for another mental illness.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Data show high rates of comorbid substance use disorders and anxiety disorders—which include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Substance use disorders also co-occur at high prevalence with mental disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), psychotic illness, borderline personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. Patients with schizophrenia have higher rates of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use disorders than the general population. Around 1 in 4 individuals with SMI also have an SUD.

                        <p class="direction">There are many people out there who specialize in Substance Use Disoder have chosen their careers because they care about others, they genuinely want to help us get through these troubling times in our lives. You also have those who are recovering addicts themselves who are now helping countless others in thier journeys in recovery. Their are Advocacy Projects, Recovery Coaches, 12 Step Recovery Programs (A.A., N.A., etc.), Faith Based Recovery Programs ( Celebrate Recovery), Sponsors, and many other options in addition to professional treatment avenues. The process is by no means an easy one for any one of us, and I bet everyone will have a story that is very different but so similar at the same time, but no matter what, there is always a resource out there for what you need SOMEWHERE! You just need to ASK! One of us has been where you are at some point in our walk and knows where you can find what you are looking for.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading1">How I Got Here</h2>
                     <p class="journey">I'm at this point a 40yr old woman in a Re-entry Center in Southern Maine, might I add , not for the first but 3rd time in the last 10yrs. There have been points in my life where I have been exactly where I wanted, stable, fully active in my recovery, going to support groups, attending one-on-one substance abuse counceling, employed and involved in my childrens lives on a regular basis. I was happy and I had everything I needed to be successful in  my recovery, almost. I was in a bad relasionship, and that's all it takes to pull the rug out from underneath you if your not prepared. I wasn't. I've been through this a few times and I've learned what it takes to have a successful recovery. I'm hoping I can hand off what Ive accumulated in lessons myself so maybe someone else and their family members wont have to go through the same hurt and consequence I have. 
                     Here's a little about where it all began.</p>   

                     <p class="journey2">I was born in Pennsylvania and brought up in Massachusetts. I went through a childhood of physical and sexual abuse which led to my removal by Department of Social Services, and placement in foster care by DSS at age 3 1/2. No home is perfect but you take what you can get when you come from places like I did. I was in counceling forever to deal with the trauma and loss, my dad committed suicide instead of going to prison for what he did to me and my brother. Its kinda crazy because at that age you think you wouldn't remember or understand but in our little brains we have all kinds of things figured out and the traumatic events in our lives are the ones we definitely remember, the good times are the ones that are hard to think of. I grew up, plenty of great memories with my father, Richard, who adopted me. Patsy on the other hand, she hated me for some reason, she said she never even wanted me and didn't sign the adoption papers, but thats for her to figure out. I let it bother me for too long and believe me it effected me bigtime! Anyways, I left home at 16, worked 2 jobs, quit high school, lived on friends couches or in their campers, had boyfriends that were way older than me. And then I got into my first car accident at age 16, mind you all this time I had been going to counceling for my childhood trauma, STILL! I actually liked having someone to talk to, it was nice to dump all the built up shit. I hadnt done anthing at that point in my life other than get drunk a couple times which I hated. My biological parents were alcoholics so I stayed away from it, I smoked some weed here and there and then I had ended up in a second car accident about 3 months after the first and this one was pretty serious. I ended up with some pretty significant spinal injuries and ended up in the hospital, the whole nine...Pain Killers. There it began. then from there it took about a year and a half but I had met a guy, he ended up being my childrens dad, and he introduced me to heroin, which I hated at first but it killed the pain. All the pain. Physical, Mental, Psychological issues were no longer issues, or so I saw it that way. Once I was using Heroin I was around all kinds of other substances so you know how that goes. I left Massachusetts in 2020, went to Texas to relocate. I was happy and had community connections, my sister and brother were down there, as well as my biological mother, and I had my first daughter, Lacy. Ended up moving back to Mass. in 2006 because my dad was sick and when he passed it was all downhill for me from there.  I lost my 3 daughters because I couldnt keep them away from their father and safe from our domestic issues. Ive been homeless, picking  Domino's Pizza's out of dumpsters at 2-3am, slept literally on the streets, one a park bench in the winter in the snow in Bangor, Maine. Addiction is a rollercoaster, it will take anyone to depths you would never imagine but we don't have to stay there. People who know, know this is true. Ive been in and out of prison for trafficking heroin and crack 3 times because Ive decided to sell drugs to support my lifestyle instead of staying in college and sticking with going for my Bachelors Degree in Business Administration in 2015. If my dad were here all these years I believe I'd have been successful at this long ago. Im giving it the real go this time, I'm back in college going for my degree again, Majoring in Accounting this time, so I'm gonna use the things I used for the negative thing I did to help me be successful now, Imagine that one!! If I can do it, You can do it!! Don't Ever Give Up!! </p>
